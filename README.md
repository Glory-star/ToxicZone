## Features

### Fixed Toxic Zones
- By default, Kamenka Military Base and Tisy are fixed toxic zones

- Gas Masks need filters or charcoal tablets to function properly
- Damaged or missing protective gear will cause:
  - Coughing
  - Sickness
  - Blood loss
  - Vomiting
  - Death (approximately 30 minutes after infection)
- ToxicCure injections can save infected players (at the cost of 40 health points)

- Customizable trajectories between multiple points
- Configurable zone radius (default 150m)
- Support for multiple simultaneous moving zones
- Admin tracking through logs and admin chat

### Crate System
- Special "ToxicCase" crates spawn inside toxic zones containing high-tier loot
- Default spawn rate: 1 crate per hour per toxic zone
- Crates are hidden in strategic locations:
  - Buildings
  - Bunkers
  - Helicopter platforms
  - Destroyed military vehicles
- Customizable loot tables with probability-based spawning
- Different loot configurations for each zone and crate

### Toxic Grenades
